## Features

* All the power of IConfiguration
* Load JSON from packaged sources (whitelabellers can unpack, edit, & repack the config)
* Preferences based configuration source with writebacks
* Support For
    * Xamarin 
        * iOS
        * Android
        * Including Xamarin Forms :P
    * .NET 6 is coming



## The Problem

Microsoft really did create a great set of abstractions for configuration.  You can store a set of key/values, cause a reload when a configuration source changes, & bind to strongly typed objects using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Binder. On Mobile though, NONE of the current providers aren't really well.

Why?
* A big feature for IConfiguration, is the ability to trigger a reload of it's source without restarting the application.  Changing an appsettings.json file during runtime causes the IConfiguration to trigger a reload notification. 
* Mobile doesn't really have an appsettings.json.  Sure you could put this in an embedded resource, but than it is readonly at all times other than the build process... after that - it is locked in place
* Essentially, IConfiguration becomes a string based dictionary for all intents and purposes - pretty useless considering

## The Solution

How Shiny.Extensions.Configuration brings the power of IConfiguration to Mobile!
* A platform preferences configuration source which allows you to WRITE a value back using IConfiguration[key] = value;
* A whitelabellers dream - the ability to unpack, change a json config file, and repack without trigger a build by using proper platform directories to load up the JSON files while still having the power of a proper configuration library internally.

## Setup

#### AppSettings JSON

1. Install the NuGet package 'Shiny.Extensions.Configuration'
2. Create an appsettings.json file like you would in ASP.NET Core application in your HEAD project.
    * **ANDROID:** *place the file in: Assets.  Ensure the build action on the file is set to 'AndroidAsset'*
    * **iOS:** *place the file in the ROOT of your project.  Ensure the build action on the file is set to 'BundleResource'*
3. Configure your IConfiguration using the following code in your application startup code (ie. Xamarin.Forms App).

```csharp
// store this in your dependency injection container OR static class
var config = new ConfigurationBuilder()
    .AddJsonPlatformBundle() // NOTE: you can change the name of appsettings.json to something else and pass as an argument here
    .Build();
```

#### Preferences Provider

This provider allows writes and persists across application restarts.  It is a wrapper around the Android/iOS shared preferences.

1. Install the NuGet package 'Shiny.Extensions.Configuration'
2. For this configuration source, nothing special is required, simply add the following to the configuration builder:

```csharp
var configuration = new ConfigurationBuilder()
    .AddPlatformPreferences()
    .Build();
```

> NOTE: with the platform preferences provider, changes are supported.

```csharp
IConfiguration config = ...; // build
config["key"] = "value"; // write - this will cause a persist to the platform prefs and also trigger Option reloated events
```
